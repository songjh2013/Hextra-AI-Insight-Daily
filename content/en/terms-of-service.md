Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll call "**the Site**" or "**us**"). Before you get started, please make sure you give these Terms of Service a good read. By using or even just visiting the Site, you're totally agreeing to everything here.

## 1. What We Offer

The Site offers paid subscription content and membership services. This includes cool stuff like blog posts, exclusive resources, ebooks, and community interactions. Just a heads up, some content is only for our awesome subscribers.

## 2. Your Account & Registration

*   To register an account, you'll need to provide a valid email address and set up a password.
*   You, the user, are totally responsible for your account's security and all activities under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account!
*   The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** your account if you ever violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscriptions

*   Subscription services are billed on a monthly or annual basis, with all costs clearly shown on the checkout page.
*   All payments are processed through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe or PayPal). Don't worry, the Site doesn't store any of your payment info.
*   Your subscription will **automatically renew** unless you cancel it before the end of your current billing cycle.
*   **14-Day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally happy with our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just reach out to us at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're seeking a refund. Please note, each user only gets one refund opportunity. For subscriptions after the 14-day period or for non-first-time subscribers, payments are **non-refundable** unless legally required.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property

*   All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our permission.
*   As a user, you only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our content for personal learning and reading.
*   If you're looking to use our content for commercial purposes or extensive quoting, please get in touch with the Site for authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines

*   **Don't upload, post, or spread** any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Seriously, don't.
*   It's also **forbidden** to mass download, scrape, or crack member content using technical means.
*   The Site has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions

*   We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice.
*   The Site **isn't liable for compensation** if content becomes temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions.

## 7. Disclaimer

*   The information provided on the Site is strictly for reference and **doesn't constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical).
*   The Site **isn't responsible** for any direct or indirect losses incurred by users from using our content or services.

## 8. Governing Law

*   These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
*   For any disputes arising from or related to these terms, both parties agree to first try and resolve them through friendly negotiation. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.
