# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (we'll just call it "the Site" or "we" from here on out). Before you dive in and start using our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to and accepting these terms. 👍

## 1. What We're All About
The Site offers users a bunch of cool paid subscription content and membership services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and even some lively community interaction – and that's just scratching the surface! Just a heads-up: some of this awesome content is only for our subscribed members. 😉

## 2. Signing Up & Your Account
- **Users** need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account. Easy peasy! 📧
- **You** are totally responsible for the security of your account and all the shenanigans that happen under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing your account** – that's a big no-no! 🙅‍♀️
- **The Site** has the right to **suspend or terminate** your account if you break any of these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Let's Talk Subscriptions & Payments
- **Subscription services** are billed on a monthly or annual basis, and you'll see all the juicy details about fees clearly laid out on the checkout page. No surprises there! 💰
- **All payments** go through awesome third-party payment platforms (like Stripe or PayPal), so rest assured, the Site doesn't store any of your payment info. We're not into that. 😉
- **Your subscription** will **automatically renew** unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle ends. Don't want it to renew? Just cancel in time!
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber and you're not totally thrilled with our services, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Heads up: Each user gets only one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo, payments are **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely forces our hand. So, choose wisely! 🤓

## 4. How You Can Use Our Content & Who Owns What
- **All original content** on the Site is **copyrighted by us (hubtoday)**. That means you can't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our permission. Keep it fair, folks! 🚫
- **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** to our content, strictly for personal learning and reading. It's for your brain, not your business, unless authorized!
- **Commercial use** or extensive quoting? You'll need to reach out to the Site to get proper authorization first. Let's chat! 🤝

## 5. Playing Nice: Our User Conduct Rules
- **You** are strictly **forbidden** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Be cool, not cruel! 😎
- **Don't even think about it**: You're **prohibited** from mass downloading, scraping, or cracking our member-only content using any technical trickery. Seriously, don't try it. 🛑
- **The Site** totally has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban any rule-breaking users**. We're not messing around.

## 6. Heads Up! About Service Changes & Downtime
- **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or totally stop parts or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. Life happens! 🤷‍♀️
- **The Site** will **not be liable for compensation** if content becomes temporarily unavailable due to things beyond our control, like force majeure, server malfunctions, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes, tech just has a mind of its own. 🤖

## 7. Our "Don't Blame Us" Disclaimer
- **The information** provided on the Site is purely for your reference and **does not constitute** any professional advice whatsoever (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). We're not pros in *those* fields! 🙅‍♂️
- **The Site** is **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Use your best judgment, always!

## 8. The Legal Stuff: What Law Applies?
- **These Terms of Service** will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. So, California law rules! 🌴
- **Any disputes** arising from or related to these terms? We should totally try to sort them out amicably first, okay? If that doesn't work, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. See you in court (hopefully not)! 🏛️
