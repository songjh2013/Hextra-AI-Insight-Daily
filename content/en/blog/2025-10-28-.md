This guide details the process for opening a bank account online within Hong Kong. üá≠üá∞

This guide covers five banks: HSBC, Bank of China (Hong Kong), ZA Bank, Airstar Bank, and Ant Bank. Following these steps, you can complete all online applications within a single day.

#### **Part One: Getting Ready**

Before opening an account, you'll need to gather these materials. Missing any of them means you won't be able to complete the online process. ‚ö†Ô∏è

1.  **Identification Documents**
    *   Mainland Chinese Resident Identity Card.
    *   Exit-Entry Permit for Hong Kong and Macau.
    *   Ensure both documents are valid for more than six months.
2.  **Mobile Phone Number with International Roaming Enabled**
    This mobile phone number is solely for receiving SMS verification codes from Hong Kong banks, not for internet access. You can handle internet traffic via Alipay's international data packages or your carrier's roaming service.
3.  **Exit-Entry Record Certificate (PDF)**
    This certificate is a crucial document.
    *   On WeChat, search for the "Immigration Administration 12367" mini-program.
    *   Once inside, download the "Exit-Entry Record Query Certificate".
    *   Save the generated PDF file to your phone.
    *   Just one exit record from a mainland port of entry is sufficient. ‚úÖ
4.  **Physical Card Mailing Address**
    You'll need to prepare a mainland address for receiving your physical card. This address must be provided in both Chinese and English versions. For lengthy addresses, feel free to use standard abbreviations, such as 'Building' abbreviated to 'BLDG'. üè†
5.  **Bank Applications (Apps)**
    You'll need to download the following applications in advance:
    *   HSBC HK
    *   BOCHK
    *   ZA Bank
    *   AIRSTAR Bank
    *   For Ant Bank, you'll operate via its Alipay mini-program, so no separate app is needed.

#### **Part Two: Operation Process**

The suggested order for applications is to first process HSBC and Bank of China, then move on to the three virtual banks. üöÄ

##### **1. HSBC Bank (HSBC)**

The entire application process for HSBC is completed online.

1.  Open the HSBC HK app and select "I don't have any HSBC account."
2.  During identity verification, choose "I am in Hong Kong, but I don't have a Hong Kong ID card."
3.  For account type, select "HSBC One"; this account has no minimum deposit requirement.
4.  Fill in the information:
    *   For account purpose, it's recommended to select "Savings/Investment".
    *   For tax identification number, fill in your Mainland Chinese ID number.
    *   Enter the prepared Chinese and English mailing addresses.
5.  Upload documents: As prompted, take photos of your identification. Afterward, you'll need to use your phone's NFC function to read the chip information from your Exit-Entry Permit for Hong Kong and Macau. Just hold the permit close to your phone's back sensing area.
6.  After setting up login credentials, submit your application. Approval results are typically notified via email within a few minutes.

**Regarding Card Receipt**: Your physical card will be dispatched by the card manufacturer IDEMIA via EMS from Shenzhen. We recommend following the "EMS China Post Express Logistics" WeChat service account and binding your phone number to track its delivery. If you haven't received it after two weeks, you'll need to contact bank customer service. üìû

##### **2. Bank of China (Hong Kong) (BOCHK)**

The BOCHK application process is similar to HSBC's.

1.  Open the BOCHK app and select "Open Account."
2.  For identity, select "Chinese Resident Identity Card" and confirm "I am in Hong Kong."
3.  For account opening method, choose "I am not at a branch," and for account type, select "Easy Banking" (Ëá™Âú®ÁêÜË¥¢); this account also has no deposit requirement.
4.  Upload documents: As prompted, upload your Identity Card, Exit-Entry Permit for Hong Kong and Macau, and the prepared Exit-Entry Record PDF file.
5.  Complete facial recognition and personal information entry. For account opening reason, select "Investment & Wealth Management" or "Savings."
6.  Submit the application.

##### **3. Virtual Banks: ZA, Airstar, Ant Bank**

These three ‚Äî ZA, Airstar, and Ant Bank ‚Äî are virtual banks, and their application processes are largely identical: fill in information, upload documents, and perform facial recognition.

Do note the following crucial points: üëá

*   **Address**: You must provide a detailed address, precise down to the house number.
*   **Tax Status**: Select "Only a tax resident of Mainland China."
*   **Tax ID Number**: Fill in your Mainland Chinese ID number.
*   **Exit-Entry Record**: This is required for all of them.

#### **Part Three: General Principles**

1.  **Data Authenticity**: All information you submit must be completely truthful. Banks will verify everything, and providing false information will lead to application failure and potentially being blacklisted. üíØ
2.  **Information Consistency**: Make sure that details like your name's Pinyin, address, and other information are absolutely consistent across all bank applications. ‚ú®
3.  **Account Opening Purpose**: When asked, choose straightforward options like "Personal Financial Management," "Savings," or "Hong Kong Stock Investment."
4.  **Operation Time**: We highly recommend submitting your application during working hours on weekdays for faster review speeds. ‚è∞
5.  **Account Activation**: After successfully opening your account, you should immediately log into the mobile banking app and set up fingerprint or facial recognition login. This is the crucial first step to proving your account is active. üëç
